# 🧩 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 📊 Project Overview
This project aims to group customers into different segments based on their **purchasing behavior** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.  
By analyzing the dataset, we can identify customer patterns and help businesses make data-driven marketing decisions.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Preprocess and clean the dataset  
- Standardize the numerical features  
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**  
- Apply **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers  
- Visualize and analyze the clusters to describe customer characteristics  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values  
   - Selected relevant numeric columns  
   - Scaled the data using `StandardScaler`

2. **Finding Optimal Clusters**
   - Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the best number of clusters

3. **Model Building**
   - Applied **KMeans** from `sklearn.cluster`
   - Created 5 customer segments

4. **Visualization**
   - Scatter plots showing distinct clusters
   - Centroids plotted to show group centers
   - Heatmap summarizing cluster characteristics

---

## 📈 Results
- Customers were grouped into 5 clusters based on purchasing patterns  
- Each segment shows different behavior in terms of income, spending score, or similar metrics  
- Insights can be used for **targeted marketing** and **customer retention strategies**
